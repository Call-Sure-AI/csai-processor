    *   Inform the customer of any applicable fees or restrictions.

3.  **Options:**
    *   For returns, offer the customer the option of a refund to their original payment method or store credit.
    *   For exchanges, determine if the desired replacement item is in stock and offer to ship it to the customer or hold it for in-store pickup.

4.  **Process:**
    *   Provide clear instructions on how to return the item (e.g., shipping label, in-store drop-off).
    *   Process the refund or exchange once the returned item is received and inspected.

5.  **Confirmation:**
    *   Confirm the details of the return or exchange with the customer, including the refund amount, shipping address for the replacement item, or pickup location.
